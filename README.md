# Android & CMake sample

Put his hands in the native code (C/C++) with the Android NDK can be a hard task for an Android developer used to
Java/Kotlin and Gradle.

This sample shows several use cases about how to use CMake:
- to build native library without Android Studio
- to use prebuild library (shared (.so) or static (.a))
- to depends on another native module from your native module
- to build Android application with native code.
